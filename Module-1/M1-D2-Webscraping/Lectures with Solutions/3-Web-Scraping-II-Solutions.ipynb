        "In last week's tutorial, we learned how to automatically retrieve pages from the internet through **web scraping**. We sent HTTP requests with the  ``requests`` library and used the ``BeautifulSoup`` library to parse and work with the HTML code from the response we got. This is a good start and works well for so-called **static** pages, but when scraping **dynamic** websites that use JavaScript in the background, you will notice that this approach often fails. Today, we will learn how to deal with this problem."

If the html source code you retrieve from a page does not correspond to what you see when viewing this page in your browser, you are probably dealing with a **dynamic web page**. Typically, this means that some JavaScript code is executed in the background to \"create\" the source code of the final page you see. When you scrape a dynamic page with the requests library, you will not get the final html code, but often an incomplete version where you might only see the instructions to run the JavaScript files. Some web pages also use dynamic features to actively prevent web scraping. You might then get an error message like the one in the example above. Luckily, there is another Python package we can use to address such problems."

It can automate web browsing and interactions, like clicking buttons or filling out forms, and supports a wide range of browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.
