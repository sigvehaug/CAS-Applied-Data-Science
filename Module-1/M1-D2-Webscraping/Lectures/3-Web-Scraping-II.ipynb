What is going on here? If the html source code you retrieve from a page does not correspond to what you see when viewing this page in your browser, you are probably dealing with a **dynamic web page**. Typically, this means that some JavaScript code is executed in the background to \"create\" the source code of the final page you see. When you scrape a dynamic page with the requests library, you will not get the final html code, but often an incomplete version where you might only see the instructions to run the JavaScript files. Some web pages also use dynamic features to actively prevent web scraping. You might then get an error message like the one in the example above.
