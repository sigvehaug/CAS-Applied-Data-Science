It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.\\n\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aEolGY--HYr8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723998454658,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Sebastian Heinrich","userId":"17447258035648262756"}},"outputId":"b48b75b7-6570-4f40-855d-fb4dd2b9f4f9"},"source":["# 6\n","links = cats.find(\"table\", class_=\"infobox biota\").find_all(\"a\")\n","links = [link[\"href\"] for link in links] #

By that point, the rural population were thought to be nearly extinct due to human encroachment on the forest and its resources.[4] Although there were ideas that it might be a new subspecies of wildcat, the tameness of the kittens Slater reared suggested that theoretical hybridisation with wildcats was unlikely, as did features like the long, tapered tail (not characteristic of any wild African species), a general form consistent with Asian domestic cat breeds (very unlike the cobby[5] figure of wildcats), and the mottled, blotched coat pattern (a characteristic of urban cat populations).[4] The feral khadzonzo were developed into a standardised breed, the Sokoke, which has a much more uniform appearance than the landrace cats.\\n'],\n"," ['Somali cat',\n","  19,\n","  11926,\n","  'The Somali cat is genetically similar to the Abyssinian cat.

The colourpoint markings are the result of a colourpoint gene originally found in Siamese cats.[4] The Neva Masquerade is believed to be derived from crossing the Siberian cat with Asian colourpoint cats, such as the Siamese or Thai, or possibly cats related to those, such as the colourpointed Persian cats.[3][5][6] Some cat registries may classify the Neva Masquerade as a colourpoint variety or sub-breed of the Siberian cat, while others consider it to be a separate sister breed. Regardless of its classification, all Neva Masquerade cats are selectively bred and pedigreed today in all major cat fancier and breeder organisations under the Siberian (Forest) cat or Neva Masquerade.

Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited.
